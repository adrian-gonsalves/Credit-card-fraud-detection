# Credit-card-fraud-detection

Problem Statement

The problem statement is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.
In this project, we analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. 
The data set is taken from the Kaggle website(https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and has a total of 2,84,807 transactions; out of these, 492 are fraudulent.Since the data set is highly imbalanced, it needs to be handled before model building.
